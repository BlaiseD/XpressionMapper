<p>XpressionMapper leverages AutoMapper to transform business model expressions into data model expressions.  Expression mapping provides a couple of advantages:
<ol class="list">
            <li>Improved separation of concerns:  The Entity Framework (or other ORM) layer has no knowledge of the business model.</li>
            <li>Removes the need for projection in the data layer or the need to return an IQueryable from the data layer.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
